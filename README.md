# Phishing Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

Phishing is a malicious practice where cybercriminals employ deceptive emails to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as financial details or system credentials. The term "Phishing" originated in the mid-1990s when hackers began employing fraudulent emails to "fish" for information from unsuspecting users. Cybercriminals favor phishing due to its simplicity, affordability, and effectiveness. Email addresses are easily attainable, and sending emails is virtually cost-free. With minimal effort and expenditure, attackers can swiftly access valuable data. It is essential to identify and classify these deceptive emails as spam in order to mitigate these attacks. Various machine learning and deep learning models can be employed for this purpose.


## Email Dataset

In our pursuit to develop an efficient phishing detection system, we conducted experiments using two distinct datasets: SpamAssassin and spam/ham. These datasets are open-source and readily accessible. The data collected during our experiments are cataloged below, showcasing the total dataset size and the number of phishing and legitimate emails contained within, which were subsequently used to train our model.
